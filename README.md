# Forever Quest Tint

A small addon for **World of Warcraft: Forever** that tints the quest text background a light teal, to match the Forever logo, whenever the quest was **not** part of original Classic (vanilla).

Vanilla quests keep the normal parchment. Everything new to Forever gets a teal gradient rising from the bottom of the page, and a small infinity-sign marker after its name in the quest log list and the objective tracker.

## Install

1. Download the latest release zip.
2. Extract it so you have `World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns\ForeverQuestTint`.
3. Restart the game or type `/reload`.

## Options

Type `/fqt`, or open **Options → AddOns → Forever Quest Tint**.

- **Tint the parchment teal**: on by default.
- **Add the WoW Forever logo**: off by default. Puts the logo in the top-right corner of the bar above the quest text. Works with or without the tint.
- **Tint colour**: the colour of the overlay.
- **Bottom opacity**: strength of the teal at the bottom of the page.
- **Top opacity**: strength where the fade ends. `0%` fades out completely.
- **Fade length**: how far up the parchment the fade reaches.
- **Quest name marker**: an infinity sign after the name of non-vanilla quests, in the quest log list and the objective tracker.
  - Show or hide it, and put it at the start of the name instead of the end.
  - By default it is a small icon; you can set its height, nudge it up or down to line up with the text, and adjust its spacing from the name. Or switch to a plain text symbol (up to 4 characters, so you can use any character the game's font has).
  - By default it uses the tint colour; turn that off to pick its own colour.

- **Quest objectives**: off by default. Recolours the objective lines of non-vanilla quests (in the quest log list and the tracker) from white to the tint colour, or a colour of your choice. Completed and failed objectives keep their own colours.

`/fqt id` prints the ID of the quest you have open, and whether the addon considers it vanilla.

## How it decides what is vanilla

The addon contains a list of the quest IDs that existed in original Classic (`VanillaQuests.lua`). Any quest not on that list is tinted. The list was generated from the Classic quest database in [Questie](https://github.com/Questie/Questie). A few genuine vanilla quests may be missing, and would show as teal. If you spot one, open an issue with the ID from `/fqt id`.

Only quests that are open in a quest window are tinted. Gossip windows have no quest ID, so they are left alone.

## Notes

- Compatible with Dialogue UI: its quest window gets the tint and logo too. Nothing to configure. The marker and tracker features are unaffected. Dialogue UI doesn't load on the Forever client out of the box: in its `DialogueUI.toc`, delete the `## X-Expansion: MAINLINE` line and add `, 16001` to the `## Interface:` line.
- Built for the Forever beta (interface `16001`). It relies on Blizzard's quest log art, so it may need updates if that changes.
